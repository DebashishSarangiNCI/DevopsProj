This module includes test cases for testing the functionality of the application.
It uses Django's built-in `TestCase` class, which provides a framework for writing
unit tests for Django applications. The test cases in this module are used to test
the various components of the application, including views, models, forms, and other
functionalities. These test cases help ensure that the application is functioning
correctly and that any changes or additions to the code do not introduce bugs or
regressions.
